**User-Schedulable Languages** (USLs) have emerged over the last decade as a promising new approach to developing high-performance code. USLs provide experts with great control over how to optimize their program for diverse hardware targets. USLs have demonstrated itâ€™s practicality in domains including image processing pipelines, machine learning kernels, sparse linear algebra, physical simulations, novel hardware designs, and more. Connections to related approaches and fields are numerous, ranging from database query plans and indexing schemes, over manual control of compiler passes, performance auto-tuning and other forms of system configuration, to strategic rewriting and tactic languages in proof assistance, and more.

This inaugural Workshop on User-Schedulable Languages co-located with [**ASPLOS 2025**](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2025/) on the [**31th of March 2025**](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2025/workshops-and-tutorials/) in [**Rotterdam**](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2025/conference-venue/) will consist of a mix of submitted and invited talks on USLs in all these manifestations, reflecting on past developments, exploring current trends and plotting out a research agenda for the future. We welcome talks about the foundations of USLs as well as their practical deployments, designs of new USLs in interesting domains, issues in the implementation and analysis of USLs, and historical surveys or position papers.
