We are soliciting​ 15 minute​ talks for USL 2025 on the topics described above.​ The talks can be technical,​ on new​ ideas,​ on your thoughts ​about​ future ​needs​, or other topics you are excited about. There will not be a proceeding, so the talks will not require a submitted paper.​​ If you are interested, please submit your talk [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAZBq8OYp3pHmuBinlNSG64h8ywWm45khFTcjNrMPKvKoCAA/viewform?usp=dialog).
